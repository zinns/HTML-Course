                Thought I found a way
                Thought I found a way out (found)
                But you never go away (never go away)
                So I guess I gotta stay now
                Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
                Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
                Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
                Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

                Isn't it lovely, all alone?
                Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
                Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
                Hello, welcome home
                Walkin' out of time
                Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place)
                Something's on my mind (mind)
                Always in my head space
            </p>
